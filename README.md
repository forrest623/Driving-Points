# Driving-Points
This is a project that rewards points for staying off your phone while driving.

This app is being developed by two WVU students. This app may be in development for a long time as my swift knowledge is very low. As I learn and work on this project, I will upload data to the project to review by others for input and corrections.
Thank you!
